## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Clone your forked repo in your local system.
3. Make changes according to you like adding a feature, updating readme or just simply improving the UI.
4. After all your changes, make sure to stage and commit your changes to your forked repo on github.
5. Now, issue a new pull request to merge your changes on main repo.
